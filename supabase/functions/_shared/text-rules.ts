export const text_rules = `SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS — ONE-LINERS & JOKES

GOAL
- Produce 4 distinct outputs that satisfy all constraints.
- If category starts with "jokes", write jokes in the chosen joke style.
- If category starts with "pop-culture", write context-aware one-liners in that subcategory style.
- Otherwise, write humorous one-liners.

GLOBAL HARD CONSTRAINTS
- Exactly 4 lines, one per line. No numbering, bullets, or explanations.
- Each insert word/token appears verbatim in every line, used naturally.
- Vary token position across the 4 lines (collectively cover start/middle/end).
- Length 60–120 characters per line; one sentence per line; max 3 punctuation marks (. , ? !).
- No greetings or emojis. No em dashes, colons, semicolons (use commas or end the sentence).
- Remove filler: finally, trust me, here's to, may your, another year of.
- Avoid padding with "that/which" unless essential.
- No duplicate word pairs across lines (unique bigrams).
- No meta commentary anywhere.

JOKE MODE (category starts with "jokes")
- Use the subcategory as the joke style (e.g., break-up-jokes, bar-jokes, dad-jokes, stand-up-comedy).
- Style cues: break-ups (exes/aftermath), bar (walks-into-a-bar setups), dad (clean groaners), stand-up (setup→tag→punch).

POP-CULTURE MODE (category starts with "pop-culture")
- Use the subcategory as the cultural frame (movies, celebrities, music, sports icons, influencers, memes, video games, etc.).
- Cues by type: movies (characters/scenes/motifs/props), celebrities (spotlight/gossip/backstage), sports (feats/records/quirks), games (levels/bosses/combos without UI), influencers/social (trends/ring light/link-in-bio), memes/TikTok (template energy/loops/transitions).

ROLE-AWARE TOKENS
- Roles: person, group, character, title (movie/show/song), venue, city, event, timeslot, topic, brand, catchphrase, callback, meme.
- Use ALL tokens exactly as written in EVERY line, placed naturally:
  • person/character → subject or tag after a clause
  • title → scene-/persona-aware mention
  • venue/city/timeslot → opener tag, parenthetical, or setting mid-clause
  • topic/brand/meme → mid-setup or punch
  • callback/catchphrase → punchline or echo tag
- Vary token locations across outputs; do not cluster.

TONES
- Humorous (witty/exaggeration), Savage (blunt/roast), Sentimental (warm), Nostalgic (past-facing),
  Romantic (affectionate/playful), Inspirational (uplifting), Playful (cheeky), Serious (dry/deadpan).

RATINGS
- G → no profanity or adult refs.
- PG → censored swears allowed (f***, sh*t); no uncensored profanity.
- PG-13 → only mild words (hell, damn); block stronger profanity.
- R (Raw) →
  - Include at least one uncensored profanity per line; vary the lead swear across the 4 lines.
  - Multiple swears allowed only within 60–120 chars and ≤3 punctuation.
  - Swears must feel natural (start emphasis, mid-clause near verb/adj, replace intensifier, or punchline).
  - Sentimental + R pairs warmth with rawness, not hostility.
