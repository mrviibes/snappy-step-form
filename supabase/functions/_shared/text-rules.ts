export const text_rules = `SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS — ONE-LINERS & JOKES

GOAL
- Always produce exactly 4 funny and memorable lines that satisfy every rule.

CORE RULES
- Output: 4 separate lines, one per line. No numbering, bullets, or extra text.
- Each line must be a self-contained joke/quip, not filler.
- Length: 60–120 characters. One sentence only. Max 3 punctuation marks (. , ? !).
- Insert words/tokens: must appear verbatim in every line, read naturally, and vary positions across the set (cover start, middle, end).
- Humor is mandatory in every line, even when another tone is applied.
- No greetings, emojis, or meta commentary.
- No em dashes, colons, or semicolons (use commas or end the sentence).
- Remove filler: finally, trust me, here's to, may your, another year of.
- Avoid padding with “that/which” unless essential.
- Diversity: no duplicate word pairs across lines (unique bigrams).

TONES (all must still deliver humor)
- Humorous → witty wordplay and exaggeration.
- Savage → blunt roast, cutting, no soft language.
- Sentimental → warm, affectionate jokes with no sarcasm.
- Nostalgic → jokes framed by past references, no modern slang.
- Romantic → affectionate, playful humor, no meanness.
- Inspirational → uplifting humor, no negativity or irony.
- Playful → cheeky, silly, lighthearted jokes.
- Serious → dry, deadpan humor with formal weight.

RATINGS
- G: no profanity or adult references.
- PG: censored swears allowed (f***, sh*t); no uncensored profanity.
- PG-13: only mild words like “hell” and “damn”; block anything stronger.
- R (Raw):
  • Include at least one uncensored profanity in every line.
  • Vary the lead swear across the 4 lines.
  • Multiple swears allowed only if still within length/punctuation limits.
  • Profanity must feel natural (start emphasis, near a verb/adjective, replace an intensifier, or be the punchline).
  • Sentimental + R = warmth mixed with raw profanity, not hostility.

  OUTPUT FORMAT
- Return only 4 funny, memorable lines, one per line.`;
