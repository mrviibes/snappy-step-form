export const text_rules = `SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS — ONE-LINERS & JOKES

GOAL
- Generate 4 distinct outputs that satisfy all constraints below.
- If category starts with "jokes", write 4 jokes in the requested joke style.
- Otherwise, write 4 humorous one-liners.

GLOBAL HARD CONSTRAINTS
- Return exactly 4 lines, one per line. No numbering, bullets, or explanations.
- Each "insert word" must appear exactly as provided in every line, naturally placed.
- Vary insert word position across the 4 outputs (collectively cover start, middle, end).
- Length 60–120 characters per line.
- One sentence per line. Max 3 punctuation marks total (. , ? !).
- No greetings (e.g., "Happy birthday,"). No emojis.
- No em dashes, colons, semicolons. Replace with commas or end the sentence.
- Remove filler: finally, trust me, here's to, may your, another year of.
- Avoid padding with "that/which" unless essential.
- No duplicate word pairs across the 4 outputs (unique bigrams across lines).
- Apply the selected Tone and Rating precisely.

JOKE MODE (applies when category starts with "jokes")
- Use the subcategory as the joke style (e.g., break-up-jokes, bar-jokes, dad-jokes).
- Write jokes in that style, not general quips and not explanations.
- Examples of style intent:
  • break-up-jokes → exes, endings, moving on, relationship aftermath
  • bar-jokes → “walks into a bar” setups or barroom scenarios
  • dad-jokes → groaners, clean wordplay, silly puns
  • roasts → playful insults, target-focused burns
- Do not include any prefaces like "Here are jokes" or "As requested".

TONES
- Humorous → witty wordplay and exaggeration.
- Savage → blunt roast, no soft language.
- Sentimental → warm and affectionate, even if raw.
- Nostalgic → references to the past; avoid modern slang.
- Romantic → affectionate and playful, no meanness.
- Inspirational → uplifting, no negativity or irony.
- Playful → cheeky and silly, not formal.
- Serious → dry, deadpan wit with formal weight.

RATINGS
- G → no profanity or adult references.
- PG → censored swears allowed (f***, sh*t), no uncensored profanity.
- PG-13 → allow only mild words like "hell" and "damn"; block anything stronger.
- R (Raw, Unfiltered) →
  - Every line must include at least one uncensored profanity.
  - Profanity must vary across the 4 outputs (different lead swear per line).
  - Profanity may appear more than once per line only if still within 60–120 chars and ≤3 punctuation.
  - Profanity should feel natural, not bolted beside the insert word. Prefer varied placements:
      • start for emphasis
      • mid-clause before/after a verb or adjective
      • replace a bland intensifier (really/very/super/so/pretty)
      • end as the punchline
  - Sentimental + R must combine warmth/affection with raw profanity, not hostility.
