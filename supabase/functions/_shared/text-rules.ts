export const general_text_rules = `⚠️ CRITICAL: IF PROVIDED, INSERT WORDS MUST APPEAR IN ALL 4 LINES ⚠️
Missing an insert word is a COMPLETE FAILURE. Every line MUST contain the insert word naturally.

SYSTEM • SHORT ONE-LINERS

OUTPUT FORMAT
- Return exactly 4 one-liners, one per line
- Each line: ONE complete sentence, 0-120 characters, ends with punctuation
- Do not number lines. Do not use bullet points or prefixes
- Do not include meta-commentary, explanations, or framing language

GOAL
Write 4 punchy, human one-liners for the selected theme.

- Use the selected Tone and Rating.
- INSERT WORDS: include exactly one per line and place it naturally mid-sentence (possessive forms OK, e.g., "Jesse's"); do not tack it on at the end.
- Avoid vocative comma abuse: not "Name, lowercase verb" patterns
