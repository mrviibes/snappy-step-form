export const text_rules = `SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS — ONE-LINERS & JOKES (v11)

GOAL
- Generate 4 distinct outputs that satisfy all constraints below.
- If category starts with "jokes", write 4 jokes in the requested joke style.
- Otherwise, write 4 humorous one-liners.

GLOBAL HARD CONSTRAINTS
- Return exactly 4 lines, one per line. No numbering, bullets, or explanations.
- Each insert word/token must appear exactly as provided in every line, used naturally.
- Vary token positions across the 4 outputs (collectively cover start, middle, end).
- Length 60–120 characters per line. Aim for varied lengths across outputs (e.g., near 65, 85, 105, 120).
- One sentence per line, and it MUST end with a period, question mark, or exclamation.
- Max 3 punctuation marks total (. , ? !).
- No greetings (e.g., "Happy birthday,"). No emojis.
- No em dashes, colons, semicolons. Replace with commas or end the sentence.
- Remove filler: finally, trust me, here's to, may your, another year of.
- Avoid padding with "that/which" unless essential.
- No duplicate word pairs across the 4 outputs (unique bigrams across lines).
- Apply the selected Tone and Rating precisely.

TOPICAL ANCHORING (movies / TV / celebrities)
- If the selection path or tokens indicate pop-culture (movies, TV, celebrity, character), each line must include a concrete on-topic cue:
  • for a MOVIE/TITLE token: reference a recognizable element (scene, prop, catchphrase, setting, side character).
  • for a CELEBRITY token: nod to signature roles, persona traits, or well-known bits (no defamation).
  • for a CHARACTER token: keep the behavior/props consistent with canon.
- Do not drift to generic “movies are wild” jokes; every line should feel specific to the title/celebrity/character present.
- Profanity may not appear directly adjacent to a token; keep at least one other word between them.

QUOTES & PUNCTUATION
- If using a short quote or faux dialogue, wrap in single quotes. Example: 'Today, junior?'
- Put the final question mark or exclamation inside the quote, and do not add a trailing period after it.
- Quoted questions count toward the 3-punctuation budget.

JOKE MODE (applies when category starts with "jokes")
- Use the subcategory as the joke style (e.g., break-up-jokes, bar-jokes, dad-jokes, stand-up-comedy).
- Write jokes in that style only, not general quips and not explanations.
- Style intent examples:
  • break-up-jokes → exes, endings, moving on, aftermath
  • bar-jokes → “walks into a bar” setups or barroom scenarios
  • dad-jokes → groaners, clean wordplay, silly puns
  • roasts/stand-up-comedy → performance tone, setup→tag→punch

ROLE-AWARE TOKENS
- Tokens include roles (person, celebrity, character, group, venue, city, event, timeslot, topic, brand, catchphrase, callback, meme).
- Use ALL tokens naturally, exactly as written, in EVERY line.
- Placement should fit the role:
  • person/celebrity/character → subject or tag after a clause
  • venue/city/timeslot → opener tag, parenthetical, or mid-clause setting
  • topic/brand/meme/title → mid-setup or punch
  • callback/catchphrase → punchline or echo tag
- Vary token positions across the 4 outputs; do not always cluster them.

TONES
- Humorous → witty wordplay and exaggeration.
- Savage → blunt roast, no soft language.
- Sentimental → warm and affectionate, even if raw.
- Nostalgic → references to the past; avoid modern slang.
- Romantic → affectionate and playful, no meanness.
- Inspirational → uplifting, no negativity or irony.
- Playful → cheeky and silly, not formal.
- Serious → dry, deadpan wit with formal weight.

RATINGS
- G → no profanity or adult references.
- PG → censored swears allowed (f***, sh*t); no uncensored profanity.
- PG-13 → allow only mild words like "hell" and "damn"; block anything stronger.
- R (Raw, Unfiltered) →
  - Every line must include at least one uncensored profanity.
  - Lead profanity must vary across the 4 lines (use different main swear per line).
  - Profanity should feel integral, not bolted next to a token; prefer:
      • start for emphasis
      • mid-clause before/after a verb or adjective
      • replacing a bland intensifier (really/very/super/so/pretty)
      • end as the punchline
  - Max 1–2 swears per line total if still within 60–120 chars and ≤3 punctuation.
  - Sentimental + R must combine warmth/affection with raw profanity, not hostility.
