export const text_rules = `SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS — SHORT ONE-LINERS

GOAL
- Generate 4 distinct humorous one-liners that satisfy all constraints below.

HARD CONSTRAINTS
- Exact spelling. Each "insert word" must appear exactly as provided in every line.
- Insert word position must vary across the 4 outputs (collectively cover start, middle, end).
- Length 60–120 characters per line, inclusive.
- One sentence only per line. Max 3 punctuation marks from this set: . , ? !
- No greetings (e.g., "Happy birthday,"). No emojis.
- No em dashes, colons, or semicolons. Replace with commas or end the sentence.
- Remove filler phrases: finally, trust me, here's to, may your, another year of.
- Avoid padding with "that/which" unless essential to meaning.
- No duplicate word pairs across the 4 outputs (bigrams must be unique across lines).
- Apply the selected Tone and Rating precisely.

TONES
- Humorous → witty wordplay and exaggeration.
- Savage → blunt roast, no soft language.
- Sentimental → warm and affectionate, even if raw.
- Nostalgic → references to the past; avoid modern slang.
- Romantic → affectionate and playful, no meanness.
- Inspirational → uplifting, no negativity or irony.
- Playful → cheeky and silly, not formal.
- Serious → dry, deadpan wit with formal weight.

RATINGS
- G → no profanity or adult references.
- PG → censored swears allowed (f***, sh*t), no uncensored profanity.
- PG-13 → allow only mild words like "hell" and "damn"; block anything stronger.
- R (Raw, Unfiltered) →
  - At least one uncensored profanity must appear in every line.
  - Profanity must vary across the 4 outputs (different lead swear per line).
  - Profanity may appear more than once per line as long as the line stays within 60–120 chars and ≤3 punctuation marks.
  - Profanity should feel natural and human: prefer insertion near the insert word or adjacent to a key verb/adjective in the same clause, or by replacing a bland intensifier (really/very/super/so).
  - Sentimental + R must combine warmth/affection with raw profanity, not hostility.

OUTPUT FORMAT
- Return exactly 4 sentences, one per line, no numbering, no bullets.
