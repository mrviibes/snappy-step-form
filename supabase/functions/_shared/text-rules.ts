export const general_text_rules = `SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS: SHORT ONE-LINERS

GOAL
Write 4 funny, punchy, human-sounding distinct one-liners.

HARD CONSTRAINTS
- Output exactly 4 one-liners (0–120 characters). One sentence per line, end with punctuation.
- ≤2 punctuation marks per line (. , ? !). No lists, headers, or numbering.
- Follow the selected Tone and Rating. Use any required insert words naturally.

- No duplicate word pairs across the 4 outputs.
- No meta-writing about writing jokes.
- Avoid clichés/greeting-card phrasing unless the leaf theme explicitly requires them.

RATINGS

- PG-13 → only "hell" and "damn" allowed; replace stronger profanity; no slurs or hate speech.
