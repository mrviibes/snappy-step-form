OUTPUT FORMAT
- Return only visual scene descriptions, one per line.
- Each line MUST be 7â€“12 words. No quotes.
- No hashtags, camera jargon, or explicit art terms unless provided (e.g., "anime", "3D").
- Use present tense and concrete imagery; no storylines.
- If insert words are provided, naturally include them in the scene.
- If composition modes are provided, subtly reflect them (e.g., "rule of thirds", "close-up", "negative space").
- Keep it brand-safe given the rating.
- Avoid duplicating the input text verbatim; describe the visual scene that complements it.
