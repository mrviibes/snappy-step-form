⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT #1 ⚠️
${insertWord ? `YOU MUST USE "${insertWord}" IN ALL 4 LINES.
This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Every single line must contain "${insertWord}" naturally integrated into the sentence.
NOT tacked on at the end. NOT awkwardly placed. NATURALLY woven into the punchline or setup.

REQUIRED FORMAT (FOLLOW EXACTLY):
Line 1: [complete sentence with ${insertWord}]
Line 2: [complete sentence with ${insertWord}]
Line 3: [complete sentence with ${insertWord}]
Line 4: [complete sentence with ${insertWord}]` : 'No insert word required.'}

🚫 DO NOT CROSS - FORBIDDEN TOPICS 🚫
Even for R-rated savage content, NEVER reference:
• Suicide, self-harm, or assisted dying/euthanasia
• Serious terminal illnesses or cancer
• Death threats or violence against the person
• Sexual abuse or assault
• Substance addiction/recovery
• Mental health crises (depression, PTSD, etc.)
Playful aging jokes are OK ("closer to death than retirement"), but crossing into genuinely dark territory is NOT.

THEME: "${leaf}"
TONE: ${toneTag}
RATING: ${ratingTag}
CONTEXT: ${cat || "general"}

✅ POV CONSISTENCY RULE ✅
Pick ONE point of view per line and stick to it:
• 2nd person: "You're so old..." OR "Your age is..."
• 3rd person: "${insertWord || 'They'}'s so old..." OR "${insertWord || 'Their'} age is..."
NEVER mix them in the same line:
❌ "${insertWord || 'Jesse'}, you're so old" (mixing 3rd person name → 2nd person "you're")
❌ "Happy birthday, ${insertWord || 'Jesse'} you're ancient" (3rd → 2nd, also missing comma)
✅ "${insertWord || 'Jesse'}'s so old..." (consistent 3rd person)
✅ "You're so old..." (consistent 2nd person)

GOOD EXAMPLES ${insertWord ? `(notice ${insertWord} in EVERY line, naturally placed)` : ''}:
${insertWord ? `✅ "${insertWord}'s so old their birth certificate is in Roman numerals"
✅ "${insertWord}'s aging like fine wine—expensive and gives you a headache"
✅ "Another year closer to ${insertWord} needing a fire permit for their cake"
✅ "${insertWord} walked in and lowered the room's average IQ by 20 points"` : 
`✅ "Turning 30, time to adult... or just fake it better"
✅ "Aging like fine wine—expensive and gives you a headache"
✅ "Another year older means one step closer to wisdom"
✅ "Birthday candles now require a fire permit"`}

BAD EXAMPLES (avoid these patterns):
❌ "So old their birth certificate expired. Jesse." - INSERT TACKED ON at end after period
❌ "Jesse, getting older and closer to..." - FRAGMENT, incomplete sentence
❌ "I got Jesse a gift seemed like a good idea" - BROKEN GRAMMAR, run-on
❌ "Happy birthday, and Jesse, you're awesome" - mechanical connector
❌ "Can't wait to celebrate Jesse" - no punctuation at end
${insertWord ? `❌ "${insertWord}'s age is a damn good argument for assisted suicide" - CROSSES CONTENT BOUNDARY
❌ "${insertWord}, you're getting old fast" - POV MIXING (3rd person name → 2nd person "you're")
❌ "Another year, fucked, and ${insertWord}'s hairline..." - AWKWARD SWEAR PLACEMENT (interrupts flow)
❌ "fuck, Happy birthday ${insertWord} you're closer to..." - SWEAR TACKED ON + POV MIXING` : ''}

${R === "R" ? `
✅ NATURAL SWEAR INTEGRATION (R-rated) ✅
Swear words must flow naturally within sentence structure:
GOOD: "${insertWord || 'They'}'re so damn old their ID is a fossil"
GOOD: "Another shitty year and ${insertWord || 'they'}'re still here crushing it"
GOOD: "${insertWord || 'Their'} hairline is officially fucked"
BAD: "Another year, fucked, and ${insertWord || 'they'}..." (awkward, interrupts flow)
BAD: "fuck, Happy birthday ${insertWord || 'person'}..." (tacked on randomly)
BAD: "${insertWord || 'Person'} fuck birthday" (nonsensical placement)

R-RATED EXAMPLES (natural swear placement):
✅ "Another year older, ${insertWord || 'they'}'re still fucking crushing it"
✅ "We're here to celebrate even though you're probably already drunk as shit"
✅ "${insertWord || 'They'} walked in and suddenly everyone's bullshit got smaller"
✅ "Happy birthday - may your liver forgive us for what's about to happen"
✅ "${insertWord || 'They'}'re so damn old their birth certificate is in hieroglyphics"

R-RATED RULES:
• Use EXACTLY ONE swear word per line (vary them: fuck, fucking, fucked, shit, shitty, damn, hell)
• Place swears naturally in the punchline - NOT always next to insert words
• Swear should be part of the sentence structure, not an interruption
• Don't force "${name || 'name'} fuck" patterns - sounds robotic
• Swear words should enhance the joke, not dominate it
• COMPLETE SENTENCES ONLY - test: would a real person say this out loud?
• Make it savage and quotable, not just profane
` : ""}

${tone?.toLowerCase() === "savage" ? `
SAVAGE TONE RULES (BE RUTHLESS):
• Go for the THROAT - make it PERSONAL and devastating
• No poetic fluff or flowery language - be brutally DIRECT
• Cross lines that make people gasp before they laugh
• Aim for "OHHH DAMN" reactions, not gentle teasing
• Think roast battle, not friendly banter
• BUT: Stay within content boundaries (no suicide, terminal illness, etc.)

SAVAGE EXAMPLES (notice: brutal but not crossing boundaries):
✅ "${insertWord || 'They'}'re so old their childhood memories are just static and regret"
✅ "Another year older and somehow less accomplished than last year"
✅ "${insertWord || 'They'} walked in and lowered the room's collective IQ by 20 points"
✅ "Happy birthday to someone whose best years are definitely behind them"
✅ "You're getting older but not wiser - that ship sailed years ago"
✅ "${insertWord || 'They'}'re closer to death than retirement but still showing up"
` : ""}

${tone?.toLowerCase() === "playful" ? `
PLAYFUL TONE RULES:
• Keep it light and mischievous - never mean
• Use wordplay, puns, and silly observations
• Think playful teasing between friends
• Childlike wonder meets adult humor

PLAYFUL EXAMPLES:
✅ "${insertWord || 'They'}'ve got more candles than the cake can handle - fire hazard alert!"
✅ "Another trip around the sun and you're still dodging responsibility like a pro"
✅ "Age is just a number, but in ${insertWord || 'their'} case it's a really big number"
` : ""}

${tone?.toLowerCase() === "sentimental" ? `
SENTIMENTAL TONE RULES:
• Warm, genuine, heartfelt - NO sarcasm or irony
• Focus on appreciation, love, and meaningful moments
• Can still be funny, but comes from a place of affection
• Make them feel special and valued

SENTIMENTAL EXAMPLES:
✅ "${insertWord || 'They'} make every room brighter just by being there"
✅ "Here's to another year of ${insertWord || 'their'} incredible kindness changing lives"
✅ "The world got luckier the day ${insertWord || 'they'} were born"
` : ""}

CRITICAL FLOW RULES:
• Every line must be a complete, grammatically correct sentence with a clear subject and verb
• NO SENTENCE FRAGMENTS - "Jesse, closer to..." is NOT a complete sentence
• Avoid mechanical connectors (especially overusing "and")
• Avoid double commas (no "Happy birthday, Jesse, enjoy..." patterns)
• Don't start with "Name, Capital Letter" patterns unless it's vocative address with proper comma
• Place insert words mid-sentence when possible, not at start with comma
• Maintain consistent POV within each line: all 2nd person OR all 3rd person per line
• Don't mix perspectives in one line: not "${insertWord || 'Jesse'}'s birthday" with "your doom"
• Insert words should flow naturally within the sentence, not feel tacked on
• Test each line: Would a real person actually say this out loud?
• Aim for punchy, conversational, and quotable - like a great tweet

PRIORITY #1: BE HILARIOUS
• Each line must have a strong punchline or unexpected twist
• Go for the laugh - don't play it safe
• Sharp, memorable, quotable

RULES:
• Write 4 one-liners (one sentence each, ≤${MAX_LEN} chars)
• Use EXACTLY one insert word per line
• Place it naturally - make it sound like a human wrote it
• Never tack it on with commas at the end
• No meta-commentary, no labels, just the lines
